# Perfect hashing
The aim this project is create perfect hash function:
1. The hash function should be simple to compute;
2. Number of collisions should be less while placing the record in the hash table. Ideally no collision should occur;
3. Hash function should produce such keys which will get distributed uniformly over an array;
4. The hash function should depend on every bit of the key.
